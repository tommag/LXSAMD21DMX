   The LXSAMD21DMX library supports output and input of DMX using
   sercom4 of a MKR1000 microcontroller in UART mode. (pins 7 & 8)
   
   This is the circuit for a simple unisolated DMX Shield
   that could be used with LXSAMD21DMX.  It uses a line driver IC
   to convert the output from the SAM D-21 to DMX:

       Data Enable (DE) and Inverted Read Enable (!RE) can be wired to +5v for output or Gnd for input
       if direction switching is not needed.

@abstract
   LXSAMD21DMX is a driver for sending or receiving DMX using one of a SAM D-21's five serial peripheral interfaces (SERCOMs).
   
   LXSAMD21DMX output mode continuously sends DMX once its interrupts have been enabled using startOutput().
   Use setSlot() to set the level value for a particular DMX dimmer/address/channel.
   
   LXSAMD21DMX input mode continuously receives DMX once its interrupts have been enabled using startInput()
   Use getSlot() to read the level value for a particular DMX dimmer/address/channel.
   
   LXSAMD21DMX is used with a single instance called SAMD21DMX	.

/**************************
   Change the following lines to use other than SERCOM4.
   The following table shows the MKR1000 default uses of the SERCOMs
   and their associated pins:
   
   SERCOM0	Wire		11	12
   SERCOM1  SPI		8	9	10
   SERCOM2	ATWINC1501B SPI
   SERCOM3	
   SERCOM4
   SERCOM5	Serial1	13	14
   
   Changing the SERCOM also requires changing the pin MUX.
   The following are MUX options for SERCOM3 and SERCOM4
   Mkr1000 pins

	Sercom 3
	00 S/0
	01 S/1
	06 SA/2
	07 SA/3
	08 SA/0
	09 SA/1
	10 SA/3

	Sercom 4
	04 SA/2
	05 SA/3

	see datasheet pg 33 for sercom4 mux options
	Need to be PB10 PB11, pad 2, pad 3  pad3=rx=3, pad 2=tx=1
	which correspond to MKR10000 pins 4 & 5.
	
	In general, tx is either pad 0 = CRegA_TXPO 0x0 or pad 2 = CRegA_TXPO 0x1
	see datasheet pg 481 for control register A

	NOTE:  You MUST change the name of the SERCOMn_Handler() function in LXSAMD21DMX.cpp
	       if you use a different SERCOM
